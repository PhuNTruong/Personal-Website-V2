/* Per lecture slides, we always want to validate the server
This is because clients don't always have to go through the browser to submit a request
They can also do that via CURL or Postman etc.
For example, try this command for a GET method
curl -X GET "http://localhost:1234/login.php?uname=etuong&pwd=asdf"
Note that for GET method, the query params are part of the URL
Try this command for a POST method
